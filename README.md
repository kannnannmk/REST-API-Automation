My first Github contribution. This time it's automation for RESTful Web Services using Java, Rest Assured, TestNG, Google GSON, Jackson, XML and JSON parser and Maven. The automation tests have validations for HTTP Requests, Responses, JSON data parsing and validation, finally creating the build of it using Maven with pom.xml.
